            <p>
              After conceptualizing a logo for a small business, based on the client's portrait, I was inspired to make my own vector portrait. I used a photo of myself as the reference, and created different vector elements using Adobe Illustrator. 
              Through this project, my proficiency in the pen tool improved, and I developed a better understanding of lighting and shadows, which I hope to implement in future art work. This illustration is now apart of my personal branding, and included on all my professional accounts.
              It has helped me gain more clients to do freelance work as a cartoon portrait artist for personal use or for their own businesses.

            <p>
              This logo was created for the West Indian Youth Association of Ottawa, a youth organization for those of Caribbean heritage. I've volunteered with them whilst looking for a community, and proactively took the opportunity to design a new logo for their branding. 
              The concept is based of their previous logo, however I tried flat illustration techniques with some rudimentary shading and lighting. Their previous logo acted as a reference, and color palette generator. I utilized the pen tool and shape builder on Illustrator
              to create the different elements. This was received by the organization's president and immediately implemented on their socials. It's one of my favorite logos,
              and I had a lot of fun creating it, as it also reminded me of home.

              This cartoon portrait was created a client using Procreate. I wanted to try a new art style with digital photo painting instead of vector art. This client wanted a cartoon portrait to help with their promotions for music production. I used their preferred photo as a 
              reference for the illustration. Before creating this, I tried a few sketches on Procreate to learn the software. It's much closer to traditional art compared to Adobe Illustrator. The client really liked this art piece, and wants to work with me in future for more 
              illustrated works. This has also encouraged me to learn how to draw human anatomy which will help me create my own characters for games.

              This is a personal website that showcases my skills and projects. It was built using different frontend technologies listed below, and hosted on Github pages. A web portfolio is something every developer should build.
              Before jumping into the coding, I used Figma to create the design for both the mobile and desktop view. Also, I focused on responsiveness and learned a bit more about web accessibility to improve inclusivity. I am currently working on updated this project to include a backend with Django, and hosting separately with my own domain.

              A racing game with turtle players, where the user can place a bet on the turle they think will win. With my previous knowledge in Python, I wanted to try game development. I built this simple game using the turtle library that provides different methods and assets that can be used for visuals.
              This was built for the desktop using the PyCharm IDE which is great for Python projects. Each iteration of the game will produce different results, due to the implementation of the random module.

              A classic snake game, where the user plays as the snake that eats different meals, and avoid eating it's own tail. I built this game using the Turtle library and implementing basic object oriented program concepts. 
              The snake has to avoid eating it's tail and going outside of the border, whilst hunting for it's food. The user can control the snake using the arrow keys on their keyboard. Anytime the snake catches its prey, the 
              user's score increases. The game ends when the snake collides with the border or eats it's tail. The score is displayed at the top of the screen.
