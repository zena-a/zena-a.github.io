# Web Portfolio 

## Description:
Version 3
My web portfolio is an ongoing project showcasing my skills, projects, and experience as a junior software developer. It serves as the central hub where potential employers, clients, or collaborators can learn more about me and explore my completed work. This is the 3rd version of my web portfolio with an updated design that fits my current preferences and interests.

## Features:
<ul>
  <li>
    Sleek and Responsive Design: The new design is sleek and modern, incorporating a clean layout, visually appealing elements, and a cohesive color palette to create a professional and polished presentation. It is fully responsive - first designed for mobile viewing and then upscaled for larger screens.
  </li>
  <li>
    About: A brief overview regarding the owner of the portfolio, such as their values and background. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Skills: An overview of my technical skills and specializations in programming languages, frameworks, technologies, and tools.
  </li>
  <li>
    Projects: A dedicated section to completed projects that are notable, with descriptions, tags, relevant technologies, and visuals such as screenshots or live demos. 
  </li>
</ul>

## Technologies: 

The web portfolio was built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It is a static webpage with little to no interactivity. For responsiveness, CSS grid and media queries were used.

## Future Enhancements:

This web portfolio project is a work in progress, and I have plans to further enhance it by:

<ul>

    Adding more sections such as work experience, services, testimonials, blog posts, resume button, and contact form. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Adding more projects and works to the projects section.
  </li>
  <li>
    Incorporating more interactive elements and animations to improve user engagement and experience with CSS animations and JavaScript.
  </li>
  <li>
    Refining the design and layout to ensure a seamless and visually pleasing appearance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Updating the skills section as I continue to learn and expand my knowledge as a software developer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop a backend system with Django and host the web portfolio on a custom domain.
  </li>
</ul>
